// Hello I am Tharun.Welcome to my Git-hub.
// Let's learn javascript basics in this file.
// Javascript is a interpreted language.
// It is also written in chrome browser.
// To connect the js to browser we need to create a html file.
// Type "!" to get boilerplate code in vs code.
// We need to open the html file in our system to run the code in browser.

console.log("Hello World!"); // output => Hello World
console.log("Tharun is learning Javascript");
console.log("I love my Mother");
alert("Warning!");
